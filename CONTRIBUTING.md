# Hello! ðŸ‘‹

We're glad you are here!

If you are interested in contributing, please feel free to fork the repo, create a branch, and open a PR.

If your PR has something interesting or useful, it'll get merged! Feel free to reach out in the Hasura Discord Channel
to discuss ideas. We will add onto this page if there is interest.

I'll certainly be adding things to this bot, I hope to make it a bit of a QA-hub and add support for things like
Zendesk, Slack, and maybe even create threads from StackOverflow and Reddit as well.

Some things I'm interested in doing:

* Add user tracking, and add context to the bot on who the users are
* Use the user tracking to implement a leaderboard
* Instead of only marking something as solved, allow also the marking of specific messages as helpful or non-helpful
* Add a slash command for generating a "golden thread". I.e. Convert the conversation into a perfect conversation based
  on the determined final answer. Perhaps...
    1. The bot uses the entire thread to create questions to get needed details the user reveals throughout the
       conversation.
    2. The bot generates the answers to those questions, pretending to be the user.
    3. The bot generates the final answer having got the important information from the user.
    4. This new thread is used in the future to fine-tune the bot.

We host office hours every Tuesday at 10AM PST, (As in me! The guy who wrote this whole thing, *I* host the Office
hours, so come keep me company!)
